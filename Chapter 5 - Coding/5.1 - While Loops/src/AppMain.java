/* Write a program that finds and prints the first 𝟐𝟎 prime numbers.
 * Use the following pseudocode for your program structure…
 * Keep two counters
 *   𝑛: The next number to test
 *   𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡: Number of primes found
 *
 * Keep looping until you’ve found 𝟐𝟎 primes
 *   Check if 𝑛 is a prime (todo: write that method)
 *   If so, print 𝑛 and inc 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡
 * 
 * Note: The number 1 is generally not considered a prime number, by most definitions.
